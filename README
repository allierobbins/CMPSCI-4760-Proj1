This project is based on Exercise 3.9 in the UNIX SYSTEMS Programming book.

Purpose of program:
	
	This program is an expansion of the fan structure as written in Program 3.2 from the textbook through the use of a batch processing facility called runsim. The 	goal of the assignment as given by Prof. Bhatia is "to become familiar with the environment in hoare while pracitcing system calls." 



Outline of runsim program:
	
	The program runsim takes in exactly 1 command-line arg which represents the MAX # of executionsthat can be run concurrently. The program then:

	1. Checks for the appropriate command-line arg
 
	2. Initializes prL from the command-line

		-prL being the max # of children allowed to execute @ a time

	3. Variable prC is set to 0
		
		- prC being a counter for the # of active child processes
	
	4. Executes the main loop 
		
		-Checks that prL == prC
		
		-Reads input & forks child accordingly
			
			~Child process executes the testsim program to run data from testing.data
		
		-Increment prC
		
		-Checks for zombie children
	
	5. @ EOF, the program waites for all the child process to finishes, then exits



Outline of testsim program:
	
	The program testsim takes in 2 command-line args which are the sleep time and repeat factors respectively. The program then:

	1. Loops (repeat factor) times

	2. In the loop, the testsim program sleeps for the specified sleep time
	
	3. After the sleep time, a message is outputed with the process ID to std output
